Heraldus: “Hey, (name of player), you’re finally awake.”


+ “Yeah, how soon until we land?”

    Heraldus: “No more than an hour. These gyro-powered planes are
        pretty fast. Can’t wait to see the Nests, huh?”
    
    "What are the nests?"
    -> story1b

+ “Where... where is this?”

    Heraldus: “It’s... a plane? You know, the army’s plane? As in the plane
        that’s taking us soldiers all the way to the Nests.”
        
    "What are the nests?"

+ “Oh my god I’m in a freaking plane.”
    Heraldus: “Yeah? Are you feeling okay? Hit your head or something?
        Just don’t let the general find out or she’ll have you taken out of the Nest mission.”
    
    “The Nest mission?”

    a continent? They seem to be assembling a weapon of some sort, so
    it’s our job to wipe them all out.”
